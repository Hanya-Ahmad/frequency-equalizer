## Project Description:
### This project is a real-time frequency equalizer with five modes:

* 1. Default audio mode where all frequencies are divided into ten bands where users can alter the amplitudes of those frequencies through vertical sliders 

*Note: User can toggle between showing the real-time dynamic plot of the audio file and its spectrogram*

* 2. Music mode where user can alter the amplitudes of drums, flute, or guitar frequencies.

* 3. Vowels mode where user can alter the amplitudes of certain letters' frequencies.* 
* Control the sampling frequency of the signal to see the effects of undersampling and oversampling (default sampling frequency is the Nyquist frequency)

* 4. Arrhythmia mode where we plot an ECG file with arrhythmia and control its amplitude using a slider.

* 5.Voice changer mode where user can alter the pitch.
