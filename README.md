## Project Description
### A real-time frequency equalizer web application developed using python and streamlit with four modes.

1. Default audio mode where all frequencies are divided into ten bands where users can alter the amplitudes of those frequencies through vertical sliders.

*Note: User can toggle between showing the real-time dynamic plot of the audio file and its spectrogram.*

2. Music mode where user can alter the amplitudes of drums, flute, or guitar frequencies.

3. Letters mode where user can alter the amplitudes of certain letters' or sounds' frequencies to enhance them or remove them completely.

4. Arrhythmia mode where we plot an ECG file with arrhythmia and control its amplitude using a slider.

*Note: notice the decrease in the arrhythmia peaks  moving the slider to 0.*
