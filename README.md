## Project Description
### A real-time frequency equalizer web application developed using python and streamlit with four modes.

1. Default audio mode where all frequencies are divided into ten bands where users can alter the amplitudes of those frequencies through vertical sliders.

*Note: User can toggle between showing the real-time dynamic plot of the audio file and its spectrogram.*

4. Arrhythmia mode where we plot an ECG file with arrhythmia and control the arrhythmia peaks' amplitude using a slider.
